Send a nicepass string to the browser via WebSocket. The user who types it in the fastest per round wins like a million bitcoins. Stupid sick P2P gamez, yo.

## Prepare and Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/nerdfiles/myx
    $ cd myx
    $ npm i
    $ npm run server

Now go to http://localhost:3000/ and use your trackpad/mouse to triple click, select all the `<input>` field, then secondary click, copy the passphrase.
